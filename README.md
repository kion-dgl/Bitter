# Bitter

Console based hex viewer and editor similar to the hx project, 
being developed independently for programming practice.

Bitter uses the ncurses library to make console-based programming
more managable. To install the ncurses library on a Debian based
system install the following package:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
```

## Usage

Usage is similar to any other command line based editor:

```
$ bitter <filename>
```
